# Converted LEDprofiles for SimHub

This repository provides automatically converted LED profiles based on the original work from Yoep de LEDLights.

As the original profile is always manually designed for a `3-10-3` layout, the purpose of this repository is to generate
"adapted" profiles for other layouts. The generator will offset LED positions to match the left/right segments as well as
center the middle section.

Head onto [Releases](../../releases/) on the right side, download the `.zip` archive and extract the profile you need.


Some limitations apply, which are entirely based on user preference:
- extra LEDs will not be assigned
- for uneven middle sections there is no way to centre it


Known issues are [here](../../issues/).
